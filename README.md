#  Foods beverages Sales Analysis Dashboard 

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: a comprehensive Food and Beverages Sales Analysis Dashboard created using Power BI! ðŸ“Š

 ## Here's what you can expect from this dashboard:
This dashboard provides valuable insights into our sales performance with key metrics, including:

â€¢	Total Revenue
â€¢	Average Ticket Price ($)
â€¢	Total Sales
â€¢	Revenue by Category
â€¢	Quarterly Breakdown (4 Quarters)

Using DAX formulas, I calculated:

â€¢	Sales Amount:
SalesAmt = Sheet1[Quantity] * Sheet1[UnitPrice]
â€¢	Total Revenue:

Revenue = SUM(Sheet1[SalesAmt])

â€¢	Average Ticket Price:

ATP = DIVIDE([Revenue], COUNT(Sheet1[OrderNumber]), "")


This dashboard not only streamlines our reporting process but also enhances our ability to make data-driven decisions. ðŸ“ˆ
